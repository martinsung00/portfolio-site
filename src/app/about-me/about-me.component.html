  <p class="about-me">
    As a lover of Sci-Fi stories and Artifical Intelligence, I have always been
    fascinated by computers. And soon, what started as curiosity became a career
    –– I opted to jumpstart my journey by joining a 9 month Software Engineering
    bootcamp. I am now an engineer ready to solve real-world problems; and if I
    don't know it, I will learn it.
